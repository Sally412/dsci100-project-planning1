    "  Can a player's experience level, age, and gender predict the total hours they spend playing on the server?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How data will help**  \n",
    "  I will use the `players.csv` dataset to figure out which player characteristics are linked to higher total gameplay time. The response variable will be `played_hours`, and the explanatory variables will include experience level, age, and gender. First, I will look at the data and visualize it to spot patterns that show which types of players tend to play the most. Then, I will convert categorical variables like `experience` and `gender` into factors so they can be used in regression models, and check for any missing values to handle them appropriately. Next, I might center and scale numeric variables like `age` and `played_hours` to improve model performance. Finally, I will split the data into training, validation, and test sets and apply either linear regression or K-nearest neighbors regression, using cross-validation to choose model parameters and avoid overfitting. This approach will help me identify the types of players who contribute the most gameplay hours.\n"
